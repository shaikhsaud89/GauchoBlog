A Location Based Micro-Blogging Application for UC Santa Barbara

Peak times during an Academic Quarter can be very irritating to students and faculty, especially when they need to be updated of not only events happening in and around the university campus, but available parking places for bicycles. In this video, we present the architecture and implementation of GauchoBlog, a location based microblogging Android application for UC Santa Barbara campus. We develop detailed microblogs centered around UCSB buildings using text and pictures and additionally provide up to date bike rack congestion information so UC Santa Barbara students/faculty can better understand the current campus scenario and make decisions objectively.
